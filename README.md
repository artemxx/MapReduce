# MapReduce
MapReduce is a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing based on C++. The MapReduce algorithm contains two important tasks, namely Map and Reduce. Map takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs).
